This is a recreation of packman where after eating a power pellet packman would gain a gun and be able to shoot the ghosts.
Currently the game is buggy and is not finished the gun has not been implemented, the Ui is broken, Power pellets crash the game, Only Blinky moves, the other ghost are stuck in the home and are constantly in the frightened state.	
I would like to thank the youtuber Zigurous for the assets and coding help. 

Made on Unity hub 3.11.1 and The editor version is 6000.0.37f1
